        <!-- Introduction Section -->
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                My portfolio website tells the story of my professional journey as a bilingual primary school teacher, specializing in both Arabic and English, with experience working abroad in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. The audience for this site includes potential employers, colleagues in education, and individuals interested in bilingual education. I structured the website to be simple, professional, and easy to navigate, focusing on providing clear, concise information about my background, experience, and teaching philosophy.

        <!-- Inspiration Section -->
        <section id="inspiration">
            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                I drew inspiration from the following professional portfolio websites:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Sarah Drasner's Portfolio:</strong> I admired the clean and minimalist design. It showed me how important it is to maintain a structured, readable layout.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Brad Frost's Portfolio:</strong> His focus on simplicity, accessibility, and responsiveness was key to how I structured my site.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Cassie Evans' Portfolio:</strong> I appreciated how she integrated her teaching resources into her portfolio, which inspired me to include worksheets and examples of my teaching materials.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Accessibility Section -->
        <section id="accessibility">
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Three ways I ensured accessibility in my portfolio website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. High Contrast Colors:</strong> I chose high-contrast color schemes to ensure text is easily readable, especially for users with visual impairments.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Alt Text for Images:</strong> I added descriptive alt text for all images, enabling screen readers to interpret the content for users with disabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Keyboard Navigation:</strong> The website is fully navigable via keyboard, ensuring that users with limited motor skills can easily access all parts of the site.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Usability Section -->
        <section id="usability">
            <h2>Usability</h2>
            <p>Three ways I ensured usability in my portfolio website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Simple Navigation:</strong> The website has a clear, concise navigation menu that allows users to quickly access different sections of the site.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Consistent Layout:</strong> I used a consistent layout across all pages, ensuring users can find information easily without relearning how to use the site.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Mobile Responsiveness:</strong> The site is fully responsive, adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes. I used media queries to ensure proper scaling and readability on all devices.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Learning Section -->
        <section id="learning">
            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p>Three things I had to learn or discover during the creation of my website:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. CSS Flexbox:</strong> I learned how to use Flexbox for responsive layouts. Tutorials and documentation on MDN helped me structure flexible content across different screen sizes.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Form Validation with JavaScript:</strong> I had to learn how to implement form validation in JavaScript, ensuring users entered correct data before submitting a contact form.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Accessibility Guidelines:</strong> I deepened my understanding of web accessibility by exploring the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which guided me in implementing features like keyboard navigation and proper text contrast.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Evaluation I Section -->
        <section id="evaluation1">
            <h2>Evaluation I: Successful Aspects</h2>
            <p>
                The most successful aspects of my work include the responsive design and clean, structured layout. I’m particularly proud of how well the site functions across different devices and screen sizes. Additionally, I think the clear, accessible navigation adds to the overall usability and accessibility of the site.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Evaluation II Section -->
        <section id="evaluation2">
            <h2>Evaluation II: Areas for Improvement</h2>
            <p>
                One area I could improve is the inclusion of more interactive elements. While I focused on simplicity, I believe future versions could include more dynamic features, such as animated transitions or interactive teaching examples. I would also invest more time into optimizing the site’s loading speed by compressing images and refining the code further.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Resources Section -->
        <section id="resources">
            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. MDN Web Docs:</strong> [Online]. Available at: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/</a> – This was a primary source of information on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
                <li><strong>2. W3Schools:</strong> [Online]. Available at: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">https://www.w3schools.com/</a> – I used W3Schools for quick references on CSS Flexbox and form validation.</li>
                <li><strong>3. CodePen:</strong> [Online]. Available at: <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank">https://codepen.io/</a> – I explored interactive elements for inspiration but ultimately didn’t incorporate them yet.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Appendices Section -->
        <section id="appendices">
            <h2>Appendices</h2>
            <h3>Site Map:</h3>
            <p>
                The site consists of five main pages: Home, About Me, Portfolio, Teaching Philosophy, and Contact.
            </p>

            <h3>Wireframes & Mock-ups:</h3>
            <p>
                Wireframes were created using a simple sketch, which outlined the layout of each page. The structure was kept minimal to ensure the content remains the focal point.
