            <h1>My Teaching Philosophy</h1>
            <p>
                As a bilingual educator, I believe in the power of language to shape young minds. My teaching philosophy revolves around creating an inclusive environment where every child, including those with SEN, feels valued and supported. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Working with students from different cultures, especially in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, has taught me to adapt my methods to best serve diverse classrooms. My focus is on personalized learning that empowers children to take charge of their education.
